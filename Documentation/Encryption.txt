Public/Private Key Encryption
Overview
The blockchain incorporates and demonstrates a basic example of public-key encryption and decryption. It uses a simplified version of the RSA algorithm to showcase the core concepts of public and private keys, modular exponentiation, and encryption/decryption operations.

Key Concepts
Key Generation: The program simulates the generation of public and private keys using small prime numbers (p and q). The modulus (n) and public/private exponents (e and d) are calculated based on these primes.

Modular Arithmetic: The program utilizes modular arithmetic operations for encryption and decryption. These operations ensure that the ciphertext can be decrypted correctly using the private key.

Encryption: The encrypt function performs modular exponentiation of the plaintext using the public exponent and modulus. This generates the ciphertext, which can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

Decryption: The decrypt function performs modular exponentiation of the ciphertext using the private exponent and modulus. This recovers the original plaintext from the ciphertext.

Program Components
gcd Function: Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

mod_inverse Function: Computes the modular inverse of a number using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

mod_exp Function: Performs modular exponentiation (base^exp % mod) for encryption and decryption.

encrypt Function: Encrypts a plaintext message using the public key by applying modular exponentiation.

decrypt Function: Decrypts a ciphertext using the private key by applying modular exponentiation.


Usage:

Main usage of the encryption, is for the sensor to encrypt it's data with it's private key.
This way noone can steal it and decrypt it, because only the blockchain knows the public key.
After the data is decrypted, it will be transfered inside the blocks.

Important Notes
This program uses small prime numbers and simplified algorithms for educational purposes only. In a real-world scenario, larger prime numbers and established cryptographic libraries should be used.

The program lacks many security features and mechanisms required for actual secure public-key encryption. Security considerations include secure key generation, padding schemes, and handling of large numbers.

Public-key encryption algorithms like RSA are complex and require thorough understanding and proper implementation to ensure security. It is recommended to use established libraries like OpenSSL for real-world encryption needs.
But for exemplary and learning goals, like the blockchain program, a simplified version is enough.
