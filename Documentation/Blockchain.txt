Core concepts in Blockchain, incorporated in the programm:
1) Decentralization

What is Decentralization:
Decentralization refers to the distribution of authority, control, and decision-making across a network of peers,
rather than being concentrated in a single central entity. In decentralized systems, participants collaborate to
achieve consensus and manage the network collectively. This concept challenges the traditional model of centralized
control and offers a new paradigm for organizing various aspects of technology, governance, and economics.

Importance of Decentralization:
Decentralization is vital for reducing vulnerabilities that arise from centralized control.
By distributing authority, it mitigates the risk of single points of failure, enhances security,
and fosters transparency. Decentralization has found applications in various domains, including technology,
finance, governance, and more.

Distribution of Authority:
Decentralization involves the dispersal of decision-making authority among multiple participants,
preventing excessive power concentration. This distribution is often achieved through consensus
mechanisms that require agreement among a majority of participants before changes are made.

Peer-to-Peer Network:
Decentralized systems often utilize a peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture.
In a P2P network, each node is both a consumer and provider of resources, creating a resilient
and interconnected structure without the need for a central server.

Redundancy and Resilience:
Decentralization inherently offers redundancy. If one node fails or goes offline, the network
continues to operate smoothly. This resilience makes decentralized systems less susceptible to outages or attacks.

Enhanced Security:
Decentralization mitigates the risk of a single point of failure, making it more challenging
for malicious actors to compromise the entire system. Even if some nodes are compromised,
the network remains operational.

Increased Privacy:
Decentralization can enhance privacy by reducing the need for centralized entities to store
and manage personal data. Participants have more control over their information, reducing the
exposure of sensitive data.

Reduced Single Points of Failure:
Centralized systems are vulnerable to disruptions caused by central points of control.
Decentralized systems distribute control, reducing the impact of failures or attacks on the
network's overall functionality.

Empowerment of Individuals:
Decentralization empowers individuals by giving them greater control over their digital interactions.
Participants have the ability to validate and participate in transactions without relying on intermediaries.

2) Distributed Ledger
A blockchain maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks.
Each block contains a batch of transactions, and these blocks are linked together in a chronological order, forming a chain.
This ledger is replicated and maintained on every participating node.

3) Cryptographic Hashing
Cryptographic hashing is a process that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters.
Hash functions are designed to be fast to compute, irreversible, and deterministic.
They are widely used for data integrity verification and digital signatures.

Irreversibility: It's computationally infeasible to reverse a hash function and retrieve the original input data from the hash.
Deterministic: The same input will always produce the same hash output.
Collision Resistance: A good hash function minimizes the chances of two different inputs producing the same hash value (collision).
Hash functions are used in various applications, including password hashing, digital signatures, and blockchain technology.

4) Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access.
It involves using an encryption algorithm and a key to transform data into a format
that is unreadable without the corresponding decryption key.

Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Examples include RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

Encryption ensures data confidentiality, preventing unauthorized parties from understanding the
content even if they gain access to the ciphertext.

5) Immutability
Once data is added to a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change.
This is due to the cryptographic linking of blocks and the consensus mechanisms that prevent tampering.

6) Transparency
All transactions added to the blockchain are visible to all participants.
This transparency builds trust and accountability in the network.

7) Security:
The decentralized nature of blockchains, combined with cryptographic techniques,
provides a high level of security against attacks and fraud.
Data is transparent, verifiable, and secure.

8) Permissioned vs. Permissionless:
Blockchains can be permissioned (private) or permissionless (public).
Permissioned blockchains restrict participation, while permissionless blockchains are open to anyone.

9) Use Cases:
Blockchains have applications beyond cryptocurrencies.
They are used for supply chain management, voting systems, identity verification, medical records, digital ownership, and more.

Concepts that can be incorporated:
1) Consensus Mechanisms:
Blockchains use consensus mechanisms to agree on the state of the ledger across the network.
Different mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS),
ensure that a majority of nodes agree on the validity of transactions and the order of blocks.

2) Smart Contracts:
Blockchains can include programmable scripts known as smart contracts.
These contracts automatically execute when certain conditions are met.
They enable self-executing agreements with predefined rules, without requiring intermediaries.

3) Scalability and Challenges:
One challenge is the scalability of blockchains, as they can become slower and more resource-intensive as more transactions are added.
Solutions like sharding, layer-2 networks, and consensus algorithm improvements aim to address this issue.

Integration of these concepts in the Blockchain programm:

The main concept of blockchains is security.
The blockchain is decentralized, it runs on each computer seperately. If one of the computer fails, nothing will go wrong,
and no information will be lost. Thanks to the Peer-2-peer concept, every block is consumer and provider of resources,
creating a resilient and interconnected structure without the need for a central server.
Thanks to the blocks being in a chain, every new block will also verify the previous block,
and will be verified by the next block. This creates immutability, which heightens security. And with the help of hashing,
which with the same input will always produce the same hash output, security will be very once again heightend.
Transparency is once again used for the increase of security. The blockchain also can decide not to allow somebody inside the
network, if it thinks that the new PC is not reliable, increasing the security once again. The whole programm makes sure,
that the information it receives is neatly arragned. The newer treansactions will be in the newer blocks and it can be made sure,
that the data inside the blocks is correct.
